# IMPORTANT

You need to add the data files locally in a folder called "input". The files are too big for the upload on GitHub. 
Also, we are not allowed to upload them (Kaggle regulartion).

No worries, if you keep the .csv files in the input folder on your local machine, 
they should stay hidden from git (since .csv is added to the .gitignore file).
